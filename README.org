* EngineSwitcher
A WebExtension to switch current page between various search engines in just one click (or =Ctrl+Alt+N=), if you are too lazy to type =!b=, =!g= (especially on mobile) in DuckDuckGo.

So you can easily keep your privacy as possible as you can.

Currently supported search engines:
- DuckDuckGo
- StartPage
- Bing
- Google

For more information please see [[https://github.com/kuanyui/EngineSwitcher][GitHub]].

* Permission
For paranoid users such as me, these are all used permissions with its usages:
- =tabs=:
  - Get the URL of current page (=Tab.url= in =pageAction.onClicked=)
  - Redirect to new URL (=tabs.update({url: string})=)

- =storage=:
  - For saving user preferences in your Mozilla account (=storage.sync=)

- =duckduckgo.com=, =startpage.com=, =bing.com=, ... etc
  - For inserting =content.js= in these pages.
